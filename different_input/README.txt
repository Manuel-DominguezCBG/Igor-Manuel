In this folder, we are going to store CSV files 
in order to test our code.

NH_.csv is a CSV file that contains two variant IDs (NM_# and rs#). 

Head or column name in first row.
Rest of the rows contain variant information.
Row 6th and 7th contain some errors to check that our code identify errors.

We advise that the entered format is CSV, otherwise the following error ('UnicodeDecodeError: utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xda in ...") may occur.
